																					\begin{itemize}
																						\item \alert{irreducable} intuitively means that one doesn't have a decomposition of $g(X)$ into two non-trivial factors, so if one has $g(x) = u(X)\cdot v(X)$ then either $u(X)$ or $v(X)$ have to be a field element, trivial if one of them is a field element and non-trivial if one can really decompose it into two non-trivial parts, it's similiar to prime numbers, if have integer number, one can also ask whether one can decompose it into the product of two non-trivial numbers or whether for each decomposition into two factors at least one for them has to be the one, if one computes the decomposition into prime factors, one only has one prime factor, one cannot decompose the prime numbers into non-trivial factorisation.

																						\item Theorem (Polynomial Residue Class Ring) can easily proven with this lemma
																					\end{itemize}
																					\item \script{167}{Proof (f.)}, $\Leftarrow$: the proof of the theory is an immediate consequence of the lemma, ...is a field which means that each element in this structure here which is not equal to zero is invertible that is what we want to show, choose in this R of x bar the smallest representative, this R of x has a degree which is strictly smaller than the degree of G of X, therefore the greatest common divisor of R of x and G of X is a divisor of R of x which means that for this here the degree of greatest common divisor of R of x g of x is smaller than the degree of G of X, G of X is the product of this greatest common divisor and some Q of X and the degree of this is smaller than the degree of G of X and therefore the degree of this Q of X has to be greater than zero, because otherwise you come not to the degree of by this multiplication you have not the possibility to come to the degree of G of X which means the degree of Q of x is greater than zero, now we are using un irreducibility of G of x here we have found a product of some of two polynomials namely the greatest common divisor and Q of X and here the degree is greater than zero which means this is a non-trivial decomposition if the degree of the greatest common divisor is not zero then you would have a non-trivial decomposition and this cannot occur because G of X is irreducible and therefore we can conclude that the greatest common divisor has to be a field element. And then you compute the residue classes as in the previous proof which means you make a big bar here and you are using that g of x bar is equal to zero bar which means this second part here can be omitted... now you just use the property that f is a field this capital F is a field which means there is an inverse in the field of this F which is f to the power of minus 1... this means you can can take this and this is the multiplicative inverse of r of x bar... If Q G of X is irreducible you can find a multiplicative inverse to each residue class which is not equal to zero bar. And then you compute the residue classes as in the previous proof which means you make a big bar here and you are using that g of x bar is equal to zero bar which means this second part here can be omitted... now you just use the property that f is a field this capital F is a field which means there is an inverse in the field of this F which is f to the power of minus 1... this means you can can take this and this is the multiplicative inverse of r of x bar... if Q G of X is irreducible you can find a multiplicative inverse to each residue class which is not equal to zero bar, $\Rightarrow$: g of x bar is of course zero bar because if you're are doing a remainder modulo g of x then from g of x you obtain zero bar, this is a property you always have in rings and in this special polinomial ring it's immediately clear because if you multiply a polinomial with a zero polomial you obtain the zero polynomial, contradiction to this assumption that you have a non-trivial decomposition of G of X into two factors this V of X should not be Zero Bar it should be something different so non-trivial factors means that the degree of V of X is greater than zero

																						\item if p is even then the greatest common devisor of 2 to the power of k and p is at least two which is not one of course and therefore if p is even then the element is not invertible. If p is odd then the prime factor decomposition doesn't contain two which means the greatest common divisor of an odd p and 2 to the power of k is one and then we immediately have that this element is invertible which means in this special case with this theorem we can completely characterize the even elements are not invertible the odd elements are invertible
																						\begin{itemize}
																							\item $2^k$ only has $2$ and $1$ as devisors, $2\cdot k$ has a lot of devisors including $1$ and $2$, thus the gcd is $1\cdot 2 = 2$, thus $2^k$ is not invertible
																							\item $2^k$ only has $2$ and $1$ as devisors, $2\cdot k+1$ has a lot of devisors excluding $2$, thus the gcd is $1$, thus $2^k+1$ is invertible

																							\item \alert{Euklid's algorithm}: euklids algorithm computes the greatest common devisor, always works, the series of the remainders is monotonicaly decreasing and at some point one will arrive at $0$ and then one knows the gcd, because the gcd of some number and $0$ is the number itself, representation example on the right and below how to \script{158}{obtain these factors}
																							\begin{itemize}
																								\item \script{158}{Example: Euklid's algorithm}
																								\item \script{159}{Proof of Euklid's algorithm (f.)}, \underline{common devisor}: We can without loss of generality assume that $u$ and $v$ are natural numbers because some if some of them is negative then you just put in this representation the minus one let's say $u$ is negative then you can consider the absolute value of $u$ and and put the minus to $q_u$, divide $a_0$ by $a_1$ and obtain representation with $q_1$ being the quotient and $+$ the remainder called $a_2$, if one looks at $0\le a_2 < a_1$ and $0\le a_3 < a_2$ the $a_i$ are monotonicaly decreasing, second page prove that result is the gcd, common deviser means $a_n$ devides $a_0$ and it devides $a_2$, now look at the second last equation here you have a combination of a n minus one and a n you know that that a n minus one divides a n minus one and a n also divides a n and therefore a n divides a n minus 2, continue this calculation until you arrive at the first equation,
																								%and then at the first equation you see that a n divides a 0 from the second equation you see that a n divides a 1 by going from bottom to top you know that a n divides a 1 and a n divides a 0 therefore a n is a common divisor of a 0 and a 1
																								\underline{greatest common devisor}: each common divisor d of a one and a zero also divides a n, a 0 and a 1 are the two numbers for which one wanted to compute the gcd
																								\item \script{160}{Proof of representation $g = q_u\cdot u + q_v\cdot v$}, bottom, again just the same as in in the example just by substitution and you can either decide to do this from the second last equation to the first or the other way around let let's say we we start with the first equation, by using the second equation we have a representation of A3 as a linear combination of a0 and a1 and then you can do this until the second last equation% and finally from the second last equation you have a n is equal to a n - 1 - q n - 1 * a n minus one and you're using this for substitution and finally you obtain a n is equal to [representation], 
																								from the first equation we can see that a A2 is a combination of a0 and a1 from the second that A3 is a combination of a0 and A1 and and finally from the second class we conclude that a n is a linear combination of a0 and a1
																								%, we show a n is a common devisor and then we show it's a greatest common devisor
																								\item the approach to compute a representation of $gcd(a_0, a_1)$ as a linear combination of $a_0$ and $a_1$ (proof above) is called \script{161}{\enquote{Extended} Euklid's algorithm}, extended euklids algorithm computes the representation of the greatest common divisor by a linear combination of the original numbers
																							\end{itemize}
																						\end{itemize}
																						\item \script{162}{Proof with help of the Lemma(MA)}, $\Leftarrow$: n bar is equal to zero bar because you're considering the remainder by dividing by n if you divide n by n you obtain one and the remainder is zero therefore this here is zero, this is by the way a method to compute the inverse in such a residue class ring if the greatest common devisor of some element a with n is greater than one then you don't have to look for an inverse because there doesn't exist an inverse, if the greatest common divisor of A and N is one then you apply euklids algorithm you're doing those substitutions of extended euklids algorithm and by those substitutions you obtain representation of one as a combination of A and N and from this you immediately have the multiplicative inverse which is q A bar, so in this extended euklids algorithm you are Computing this QA and a qn you are not interested in the qn but you are interested in the QA because the residue class of this QA is exactly the multiplicative inverse you're looking for, $\Rightarrow$: or in other words the difference of a * B and 1 is a multiple of n or you can say... assume that the greatest common divisor of A and N is some D which means that a is equal to some QA * d and n is equal to some qn * D which is just a definition here we are not using greatest common devisor but we are using common devisor, we insert this here for a in this equation we insert this here for n in this equation, now we just have to have a close look at this equation and use the fact that all numbers here are integers so you have D * and QA is an integer B is an integer Y and qn is an integer you have D * some integer is equal to 1 if D * some integer is equal to one then we can immediately conclude that D is one because otherwise it doesn't work

																	\item \script{103}{Round Structure} $X$ instead of $P$, $Y$ instead of $C$. In the last round do the same omitting the MixColumn Layer (\href{https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/1346/why-is-mixcolumns-omitted-from-the-last-round-of-aes}{\inlinebox{reason}})
																	\item \script{104}{Internal Structure (f.)}: $16$ bytes block size, arranged in a $4x4$ matrix
																	\begin{itemize}
																		\item \alert{Byte Substitution Layer:} Don't need matrix, is done \textit{Byte by Byte}, S-Box / functions $S$ \alert{identical} for all $16$ bytes, propably to save memory, because a $S$-Boxe is usually represendet in software implementation by a \script{107}{Lookup Table} ($1$-to-$1$ mapping, so no value in the results / cells of table which occurs twice, always the same lookup table for all implementations for AES, it is part of the specification of AES) with input values $0$ to $2^8-1 = 255$ (\script{106}{reference}), S-Boxes are the only \alert{nonlinear} ($ByteSub(A_i) \oplus ByteSub(A_j) \ne ByteSub(A_i \oplus A_j)$) elements of AES and they are \alert{bijective}, i.e. a $1$-to-$1$ mapping of input and output bytes. Can also be described as computing the multiplicative inverse in $GF(2^8)$. Because of the nonlinaer elements, the S-Boxes one can't use that there's a connection between plaint text and cipher text because of linearity
																		\item \alert{Diffusion Layer:}  Provides diffusion over all input state bits. Performs a linear operation on state matrices A and B, i.e., $DIFF(A) \oplus DIFF(B) = DIFF(A \oplus B)$
																		\begin{itemize}
																			\item \script{109}{ShiftRows Layer}: Permutation of the data on a \alert{byte level}. Rows of the state matrix are shifted cyclically
																			\item \script{110}{MixColumn Layer}: Matrix operation which combines (\enquote{mixes}) blocks of $4$ bytes. Can't be decribed by permutation of Bytes or Bits, the input can have more or less bits equal to $1$ then the output. Linear transformation which mixes each column of the state matrix. Each $4$-byte column is considered as a vector and multiplied by a fixed $4\times 4$ matrix. All arithmetic is done in the \alert{Galois field} $GF(2^8)$, where $GF(2^8)$ is $\{0, 1\}^8$ with addition as bitwise $Xor$ and an \enquote{appropriate} multiplication. Boxes are \alert{identical} for all terms, so one does multiplication with the same matrix and this matrix is fixed for AES. This matrix needs to have the property of being \alert{invertable}
																		\end{itemize}
																		\item \script{111}{Key Addition Layer}: Bitwise Xor, in round number $i$ one \enquote{adds} the $16$-byte \alert{state matrix} $C = C_0C_1\ldots C_{15}$ with the $16$-byte \alert{subkey / round key} $k_i$: $C \oplus k_i$. The subkeys are generated in the \alert{key schedule}, they are derived from the original key $k$. Is the only part that depends on the key and everything is else is to hide what one did and make the decryption without knowing the key much more difficult, such that it's never much simpler than a brute-force attack for which the number of keys is too large.
																		\begin{itemize}
																			\item \script{113}{Key Schedule (pr.,f.)}, subkeys are derived recursively from the original 128/192/256-bit input key, $\#subkeys = \#rounds + 1$, each round has $1$ subkey, plus $1$ subkey at the beginning of AES. \alert{Key whitening:} Subkey is used both at the input and output of AES. There are different key schedules for the different key sizes. Called subkeys, because for key-length 192 and 256 they are subkeys, for 128 too even though it doesn't make sense to call them subkeys. The only really random part os the original key. The round key number $0$ is the original key. If one would also do it the same for the first, one would have a cyclic dependency. For round key $2$ its almost the same with the difference, that in the different rounds the $g$ functions are slightly different. \script{114}{Function $g$} rotates its four input bytes and performs a bytewise S-Box substitution (\textit{the same} as before) $\rightarrow$ nonlinearity. The \alert{round coefficient} RC is only added to the leftmost byte and \textit{varies from round to round}. Until $RC[8]$ it is leftshift, then one can't shift anymore and chooses elements of the Galois field again. \underline{Hint:} Multiplication in Galois field has something to do with multiplicatin of polynomials. Only on byte where on adds this $RC[i]$. $x_i$ represents an element in the Galois field $GF(2^8)$
																			% , in each round transformation of the original key, for keywidth 128 one has $10$ rounds and for them one needs $11$ round keys derived from the secret key $k$,
