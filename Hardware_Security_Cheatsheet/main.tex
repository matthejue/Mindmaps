	\begin{betterlist}
		\item \alert{Hardware Security} goes beyond classical cryptography. It protects the implementations of cryptographic algorithms against physical attacks, side-channel attacks etc. Avoids tampering with devices
		\item \alert{Security} entails that the system fulfills certain security properties which an intelligent attacker seeks to undermine. No static and complete definition or classification. \alert{Important security properties (\enquote{CIAAN}) are:}
		\begin{betterlist}
			\item \alert{Confidentiality:} Protecting confidential information from being disclosed to unauthorized parties. (no unauthorized reads)
			\item \alert{Integrity:} Ensuring that information is only modified by authorized parties. (no unauthorized writes)
			\item \alert{Availability:} Making sure that information and systems are accessible to authorized parties when they need them (e.g. resistance to denial-of-service attacks).
			\item \alert{Authenticity:} Ensuring that information and communication come from the source they are supposed to come from.
			\item \alert{Non-repudiation:} Ensuring that nobody can deny having performed certain actions (like sending / receiving messages, changing data etc.).
		\end{betterlist}
		\item \alert{Vulnerability:} Weakness in the secure system
		\item \alert{Threat:} set of circumstances that has the potential to cause loss or harm
		\item \alert{Attack:} The act of a human exploiting the vulnerability in the system
		\item \alert{Safety:} System is designed without any error leading to unintended behavior. (\alert{design time})
		\item \alert{Reliability:} A correctly designed system continues to work correctly during its \alert{life-time}
		\begin{betterlist}
			\item \underline{relationship between security and safety / reliability:} Port for monitoring the system good for safety / reliability, but bad for confidentiality of the processed data. Safety problems (erroneous implementations) may also lead to security problems
		\end{betterlist}
		\item \underline{Possible Actions of Adversaries, Attacks:}

			\item Reverse engineering of ICs
			\item Spying by exploiting IC vulnerabilities (\enquote{backdoors})
			\item Physical attacks, side-channel attacks, fault injection

		\end{betterlist}
		\item \underline{Examples for Countermeasures to Attacks:}
		\begin{betterlist}
			\item Encrypting secret data
			\begin{betterlist}

	\begin{betterlist}
		\item \underline{Problem 1:} Cost of Manufacturing
		\begin{betterlist}
			\item An \alert{untrusted foundry} may overproduce ICs and sell overproduced chips on its own account
			\item An \alert{untrusted assembly} may sell defective ICs, sell out-of-spec ICs (possibly noticed only by early aging, e.g.), mark correct ICs as defective and sell them on its own account
		\end{betterlist}
		\item \underline{Problem 2:} Design Complexity
		\begin{betterlist}
			\item buy design data as \alert{intellectual property} ($=$ \alert{IP}) from other companies
			\item \alert{IP Vendors} are located across the world. No control on the design process. Safety and security problem
		\end{betterlist}
		\item \underline{Several parties may be untrusted:} IP vendors (untrusted IP), System integrator (untrusted system, IP piracy), Fab (untrusted IC, IC Piracy (Counterfeiting)), Assembly (IC Piracy (Counterfeiting))
		\item  \alert{Counterfeit} chips are not restricted to Overproduced chips (foundry) and Defective / out-of-spec chips (assembly + test). The whole IC life cycle and supply chain is affected: \alert{Recycled ICs} and \alert{Cloned ICs}

					\item frequency of pairs is somewhat hidden. Works if the attacker doesn't know that polyalphabetic substitution with $n$ keys is used

				\item \alert{Implementation in Software:} straightforward implementation is well suited for $8$-bit processors (e.g., smart cards) with small amount of memory, because operations are on bytes, but inefficient on $32$-bit or $64$-bit processors.
				\item \alert{T-Tables:} When executing MixColumn for one column of the state matrix one can speed up the calculation of the resulting vector which is made of $4$ \alert{columns} with one entry of the column of the state matrix multiplied with the values of one column of the $4\times 4$ matrix with $3$ exor operations between the columns. There are $2^8$ possible values for this one value from the column of the state matrix, thus one needs a lookup table with $2^8$ values of $32$-bit values concatenating the resulting values of one column of the calculation. One needs $4$ such lookup tables, because the $4\times 4$ matrix has $4$ columns. One can then calculate the resulting vector by $4$ lookups to the $4$ lookup tables and $3$ exor operations.

All arithmetic is done in the Galois field $GF(2^8)$ ($\{0, 1\}^8$ with addition as bitwise exor and an \enquote{appropriate} multiplication).
