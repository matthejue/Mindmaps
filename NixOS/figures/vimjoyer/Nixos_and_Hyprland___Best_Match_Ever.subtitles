hyperland an amazing compositor that has
experienced tremendous growth since its
creation last year however since it is
based on Weyland some long time ex-users
have been hesitant to try it out today
we shall take a look at a simple and
straightforward NYX OS hyperlens setup
that includes all the necessary
components for a seamless transition
so yes unlike all the standard window
managers like bspvm I3 awesome or DVM
hyperland is actually a valent protocol
based compositor which means that it
doesn't rely on the X server
there are some advantages and
disadvantages to it right now but
undeniably Weyland is the future so
let's begin the setup with enabling
hyperlund itself if you have a not
Nvidia system all you have to do is
enable this option yes this is it only
one line on Nvidia however you also want
to enable special patches those two
environment variables and a couple of
Hardware options blr no Hardware cursors
disables Hardware cursors you might not
need this option but on my work machine
for example mouse cursor becomes
invisible without it just check how it
works for you
the sneaks OS ozone VL here hints your
electron apps like Discord to use
Wayland it should help you if you see a
black screen in those
opengl obviously enables opengl and the
Nvidia mode setting is required by most
valent compositors on Nexus if you plan
on running any X applications which you
probably do also enable this option here
after rebuild and restart you should
have your hyperlens available in display
manager but don't do it just yet I plan
this feature Rich but you probably want
some additional software with it like a
bar for example two standard choices for
hyperland are way bar if you want
something that works out of the box and
is quite customizable and alcavar's
wacky widgets if you want to have a
completely DIY solution we're gonna go
with the first one because El covers
like a Regis would require its own video
just to get started with the basics
adding packages.way bar to your system
packages should do but to have
workspaces displayed correctly on
hyperlens you also want to add a special
override of attributes now you might not
need this step depending on when you are
watching this video but adding it won't
do any harm anyway
some other useful software pieces that
you definitely want to have with
hyperlund are
a notification demon like danced or Maco
X users should be familiar with the
first one and second one is pure valent
we will take a closer look at one of
them later in the video
they depend on leave notify so add that
to your packages too desktop portals
which handle your desktop program's
interactions between each other screen
sharing link opening file opening and
such
as an example I've added xdg desktop
portal gtk but you could choose from any
other one available in NYX packages
these options right here which enable
your sound if you've recently installed
Nexus you should have them enabled by
default by fire is also used on valent
for screen sharing one of these
wallpaper demons they all are great and
have unique features but we're gonna
take a closer look at swww
as a confident terminal user you also
want to have a great terminal emulator
I've compiled a small list of my
favorite ones but you should choose the
one that suits your workflow the best
ITI is listed first here because that's
what hyperlan has set as a default with
standard config so unless you have a
radio config just put it there and
remove later and of course an app
launcher the menu is not available on
valent but all the cool guys are using
rofi anyway rophie Wayland is the
Weyland compatible rophie package or you
can choose Wolfie which is the gtk
rophie version
hyperland Wiki also suggests you try out
P menu puzzle or toffee which are all
available in next packages don't forget
to add your favorite browser text editor
messaging apps and that should suffice
for our first boot this is what you're
gonna see after booting up your hyperlan
desktop for the first time at the top
piperland will suggest you to edit its
configuration file so let's do exactly
that
like I mentioned previously by default
hyperlund assumes that you are using
Kitty so let's open it by pressing super
plus Q
navigate to your dot config
hyperdirectory where you will see the
hyperlan.com file edit it with your
favorite Text Editor to remove the nasty
message we need to comment this Auto
generated line if you scroll down you
can also see all of your key bindings
listed here to launch your application
without opening a terminal we're gonna
add rophie here like this
you can edit other options to your
liking the configuration is really not
that difficult however if you'd like me
to create an advanced hyperlink
configuration tutorial please let me
know in the comment section but now we
want to actually make use of our other
software let's begin by adding this line
at the bottom of our hyperlink
configuration file it will call a batch
script on Startup so we can put all of
the stuff there
use Touch command to create a file you
can also call it any other name you want
but don't forget to mod it so it is
executable
here's what the file should look like we
are initializing wallpaper Daemon and
later setting the image to any path on
your system
I've also included network manager
applet which is this handy thing right
here
waybar and Dunst are also here
I've added ampersands to the end of each
line to make them non-blocking make sure
to also have slash user slash Bean slash
and Bash here because nixos doesn't have
Apache available in slash bin directory
doing this is also a great practice on
any other register
now restart hyperlan by pressing super M
or reboot your system
this is how your newly acquired bar
should look like take some time to
customize it all of the documentation is
available on the internet but if you
want to see an advanced Weber
configuration video please let me know
here you can also see the command to
make screenshots on your railout desktop
now all of the basic stuff is set up all
that's left is to tweak everything to
your liking as you can see setting it up
on Nexus is extremely easy and you don't
risk to break your system by replacing
some important component because you can
always roll back my advice is to leave
your leftover desktop environment option
set to true for now because if you are
not sure which software you are going to
need it will probably be there already
and now my favorite part of the video
the one where I tell you how thankful I
am and mention the subscription thing
this time I also want to tell you about
the Discord server which I'm going to
make as soon as we hit 1000 subscribers
that's not an unbeatable goal I think
but more of a reason for me to delay it
a bit because I'm constantly busy make
sure to leave a like comment and expect
more videos about Linux and Nyx thank
you again for watching and see you
