since the release of my previous
hyperland on N video from half a year
ago the home manager and nixos modules
received numerous updates with one of
them being the ability to declare your
entire hyperland configuration with NYX
syntax and so in this video we are going
to install hyperland on nyos configure
it with NYX and even install some
plugins for it declaratively so without
further Ado let's begin with the special
Nvidia patches option being removed
installing hyperland is now just as easy
as setting programs. hyperland enable
option to through and rebuilding your
system you will immediately have access
to hyperland in your preferred display
manager and in the TTI for purposes of
this video I also recommend you to use
hyperland package from the official
hyperland flake because it will give us
more control when we get to installing
plugins we will obviously use home
manager extensively today so if you
don't have a home manager setup yet now
is the perfect time to check out the
ultimate guide video or install it
yourself open your home. n file or any
other Home manager module and let's
begin configuring hyperland most of the
magic happens in the settings option but
if you check the home manager options
list with manome configuration. n
command you will see that none of its
sub options are explicitly listed and
that is because like many other Home
manager options this one gets translated
into hyperland syntax dynamically if we
take a look at its example definition we
can see that it Bears a strong
resemblance to hyperland syntax meaning
we only have to learn a few differences
between them to begin declaring it
firstly to avoid confusing mix language
options with special symbols like dollar
sign or dot need to be surrounded with
double quotes secondly hyperland allows
us to assign many key bindings with the
same bind command which is not possible
with Nick syntax due to the set Keys
being unique this problem is solved by
adding all values into a list and
assigning it to a single bind attribute
this also works for any other hyperon
commands like animations or exact ones
lastly the value part of every hyperline
line is treated like a simple string
with NYX syntax so even if it contains
spaces commas or parentheses wrap
between some double quotes and you are
done you can now easily configure
hyperland with commands and values found
on the wiki simply by slightly adjusting
the syntax but the obvious question is
why would you want to configure
hyperland with Nyx in the first place
and the answer of course is to make use
of the Nyx features with the most basic
example being NYX colors just by
interpolating Bas 16 colors into active
and inactive borders you can synchronize
your hyperland colors with the rest of
your system a more complex example would
be aligning entire shell scripts for key
bindings or startup execution we can
also interpolate binary path into those
scripts to further improve our
configuration finally we can expose
options that will affect our
configuration allowing us to have
different layouts monitor setups or even
key bindings on different machines while
still reusing all other parts this
example is pretty simple but if you
include conditional logic in these
Expressions you can come up with some
very interesting results just like the
monitors option from the home manager
modules video which you can find in the
link in the description another benefit
of using NY to configure hyperland is
the ease of installing plugins while
recently introduced hyperm plugin
manager is recommended to use on other
dis rows the official hyperland plugins
repo still includes a flake let's use it
right now by including it in your flake
inputs and making it follow hyperland
flake to ensure that you never get
version mismatches we can finally go
back to our home manager module to
install some plugins let's try it out by
adding borders Plus+ plugin to our
plug-in list and then configuring it as
shown on the GitHub page rebuild your
home manager configuration and as you
can see we now have double borders
around every window packaging your own
plugins is also very simple because if
you take a look at all default. NX files
in the hyperland plugin repo you will
see that all they do is compile C++ code
against the hyperland version which we
passed to it in the flake and now I
