              % - Avoids tampering with devices

                        \item \script{116}{Inv MixColumn layer (f.)}, to reverse the MixColumn operation, each column of the state matrix $C$ must be multiplied with the inverse of the $4\times 4$ matrix, \script{117}{identity matrix}, all arithmetic is done in $GF(2^8)$. Useful that in the encryption one used matrix that is \alert{invertable}
                       \item \script{118}{Inv ShiftRows layer}, all rows of the state matrix B are shifted to the opposite direction (now right)
\item \alert{Inv Byte Substitution layer}, since the S-Box is bijective, it is possible to construct an inverse, such that $A_i = S^{â1}(B_i) = S^{â1}(S(A_i))$. The inverse S-Box is used for decryption. It is usually realized as a lookup table. Inverse Lookup Table easy to get from Lookup Table

Can also be described as computing the multiplicative inverse in $GF(2^8)$. Because of the nonlinaer elements, the S-Boxes one can't use that there's a connection between plaint text and cipher text because of linearity
                          \item \alert{Diffusion Layer:}  Provides diffusion over all input state bits. Performs a linear operation on state matrices A and B, i.e., $DIFF(A) \oplus DIFF(B) = DIFF(A \oplus B)$

                              \item \script{110}{MixColumn Layer}: Matrix operation which combines (\enquote{mixes}) blocks of $4$ bytes. Can't be decribed by permutation of Bytes or Bits, the input can have more or less bits equal to $1$ then the output. Linear transformation which mixes each column of the state matrix. Each $4$-byte column is considered as a vector and multiplied by a fixed $4\times 4$ matrix. All arithmetic is done in the \alert{Galois field} $GF(2^8)$, where $GF(2^8)$ is $\{0, 1\}^8$ with addition as bitwise $Xor$ and an \enquote{appropriate} multiplication. Boxes are \alert{identical} for all terms, so one does multiplication with the same matrix and this matrix is fixed for AES. This matrix needs to have the property of being \alert{invertable}
                            \end{itemize}
                          \item \script{111}{Key Addition Layer}: Bitwise Xor, in round number $i$ one \enquote{adds} the $16$-byte \alert{state matrix} $C = C_0C_1\ldots C_{15}$ with the $16$-byte \alert{subkey / round key} $k_i$: $C \oplus k_i$. The subkeys are generated in the \alert{key schedule}, they are derived from the original key $k$. Is the only part that depends on the key and everything is else is to hide what one did and make the decryption without knowing the key much more difficult, such that it's never much simpler than a brute-force attack for which the number of keys is too large.
                            \begin{itemize}
                              \item \script{113}{Key Schedule (pr.,f.)}, subkeys are derived recursively from the original 128/192/256-bit input key, $\#subkeys = \#rounds + 1$, each round has $1$ subkey, plus $1$ subkey at the beginning of AES. \alert{Key whitening:} Subkey is used both at the input and output of AES. There are different key schedules for the different key sizes. Called subkeys, because for key-length 192 and 256 they are subkeys, for 128 too even though it doesn't make sense to call them subkeys. The only really random part os the original key. The round key number $0$ is the original key. If one would also do it the same for the first, one would have a cyclic dependency. For round key $2$ its almost the same with the difference, that in the different rounds the $g$ functions are slightly different. \script{114}{Function $g$} rotates its four input bytes and performs a bytewise S-Box substitution (\textit{the same} as before) $\rightarrow$ nonlinearity. The \alert{round coefficient} RC is only added to the leftmost byte and \textit{varies from round to round}. Until $RC[8]$ it is leftshift, then one can't shift anymore and chooses elements of the Galois field again. \underline{Hint:} Multiplication in Galois field has something to do with multiplicatin of polynomials. Only on byte where on adds this $RC[i]$. $x_i$ represents an element in the Galois field $GF(2^8)$
% , in each round transformation of the original key, for keywidth 128 one has $10$ rounds and for them one needs $11$ round keys derived from the secret key $k$,
