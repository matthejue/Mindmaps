    Our journey begins at the \alert{\enquote{Stadtgarten} (city garden)}, established in 1888 as part of an ambitious urban development plan following Freiburg’s industrial growth and the increasing popularity of public green spaces across Germany. Its design was influenced by the ideals of the English landscape garden, with winding paths, a pond, and gently rolling lawns. Until 1911, it even required an entrance fee. 

    This green oasis has evolved into both a cherished public park and a living museum of horticultural (cultivation of gardens and plants for decorative or practical use) and arboricultural (care and management of trees and shrubs) richness. The Stadtgarten is known for its rose gardens, including up to 250 varieties of roses, which can be found in the countless flower beds.% which was originally planted in the 1920.

    % A key feature is the cable car station at the edge of the park, from which the Schlossbergbahn funicular railway has been operating since 2008, offering visitors a direct route to the Schlossberg’s panoramic viewpoints.

		Our trip continues to the \alert{\enquote{Schlossberg} (castle hill)}, the towering hill that rises to the east of Freiburg’s \enquote{Altstadt} (old town), offering not only stunning panoramic views of the city and the Rhine Valley, but also a deep and complex history stretching back over a thousand years.

		In 1091, \alert{Berthold II of Zähringen}, Duke of Swabia and founder of Freiburg, constructed a fortress on the Schlossberg. This castle, known as the Castellum de Friburch, was the power base for the Zähringer family and gave Freiburg its name: \enquote{frei Burg} meaning \enquote{free castle}.

		% The castle's location allowed the Zähringers to control key trade routes through the Black Forest and the Dreisam Valley. The original castle was likely a mix of stone and timber structures, fairly modest by later standards, but it was formidable for its time.
		After the Zähringers died out in 1218, the castle passed to the \alert{Counts of Urach}, later known as the Counts of Freiburg, and eventually to the Habsburgs, who ruled the region for centuries.

		% The Schlossberg, \enquote{literally Castle Hill}, has always held strategic importance due to its elevation and its commanding view over the surrounding region. Archaeological evidence suggests that the hill was used for fortified settlements as early as the Bronze Age, but its most significant period began in the 11th century.
		\alert{Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban (1633–1707)} was a brilliant French military engineer and Marshal of France under King Louis XIV. Vauban is widely regarded as one of the greatest minds in military architecture, revolutionizing fortification design during the age of gunpowder.

		Vauban’s hallmark was his distinctive \alert{star-shaped fortress system}, designed to withstand and repel the increasing power of cannon fire, which had made traditional medieval walls obsolete. Instead of relying on high vertical walls, which could be easily destroyed by artillery, Vauban used low, angled ramparts to deflect cannonballs, Bastions and zigzag-shaped outer defenses to eliminate blind spots and allow overlapping fields of fire, moats, earthworks, and tunnels to absorb shock and delay attackers.

		Freiburg came under French occupation in 1677 during the Franco-Dutch War, and Vauban was ordered to transform the city into a modern fortress at the edge of French-controlled territory.

		From 1679 to 1681, and again after another French occupation in 1744, he oversaw the construction of an enormous fortress complex on the Schlossberg and redesigned the city’s defenses to match his cutting-edge military theories.

		After the \alert{Treaty of Ryswick in 1697}, Freiburg reverted to Austrian control, and the French were forced to destroy the fortifications in 1745 during the War of the Austrian Succession. They did so thoroughly: the entire fortress was blown up with explosives, and much of what remained was later quarried for building stone.
		% Though most of the fortress was blown up in 1745 during France's withdrawal (as required by treaty), the legacy of Vauban’s work remains etched into the landscape and memory of Freiburg—especially on the Schlossberg, where remnants of his fortifications are still visible.

		In the 1990s, Freiburg took a bold step in urban planning and named a new sustainable district after the famed engineer. The Vauban district, located on the site of a former French military base (used after World War II), became a model eco-neighborhood when development began in 1998.

		On the Schlossberg, we're going to see a lot of interesting sights that bring Freiburg’s rich history, scenic beauty, and local culture to life. From former fortifications to memorials, fountains, and lookout points, each stop reveals a unique story.

    Tucked into the summit of Freiburg’s Schlossberg lies the historic \alert{Fort Carré}, a striking example of 17th-century military engineering. Built during the French occupation of Freiburg under the direction of renowned military architect Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban, the fort formed part of an elaborate system of defenses constructed between 1677 and 1681. The name \enquote{Fort Carré} is French and translates literally to \enquote{square fort} (fort meaning fortification and carré meaning square or quadrilateral). This designation reflects the fort’s original geometric layout, a compact square plan with bastions at each corner. It is a hallmark of Vauban’s fortress style, designed to maximize defense and minimize blind spots. Strategically placed as the last redoubt or fallback position, Fort Carré served as the commandant’s final point of retreat in the event of siege.

		There’s also a metal viewing tower, the \alert{\enquote{Schlossbergturm} (castle hille tower)}, built in 2002 and 35 meters tall, that gives a 360-degree view over Freiburg, the Black Forest, and even the Vosges mountains in France on a clear day.

    Descending from the forest sanctuary of St. Odile, we continue down the Roßkopf, cross the clear waters of the Dreisam, and enter the district of \alert{Littenweiler}. First documented in the 11th century as Lutenwile, Littenweiler began as a modest farming village on the eastern outskirts of Freiburg. The village's name reflects its agricultural roots, and over the centuries, it maintained a rural character, with a population comprising farmers and day laborers. In 1914, Littenweiler was incorporated into the city of Freiburg, marking a significant shift in its development.
% , nestled at the edge of the Black Forest where the Dreisamtal opens into the Zartener Becken. 

    The \alert{Dreisam River}, stretching 29.7 kilometers, originates in the Black Forest near Kirchzarten from the confluence of the Rotbach and Wagensteigbach. Its name derives from the Celtic Tragisamā, meaning "the very fast one," reflecting its swift current. Historically, the Dreisam was prone to flooding, with a notable flood in March 1896 causing significant damage in Freiburg. To mitigate such risks, the river was channelized in the late 19th century, with embankments constructed to protect the city. The Dreisam also feeds Freiburg's historic Bächle, the small water-filled runnels that run through the city's old town, adding to its unique charm.

    In Littenweiler, culinary enthusiasts can indulge in diverse dining experiences, such as the Moroccan restaurant Scherazade and the Italian Ristorante Pizzeria Colosseo. The former restaurant pays homage to \alert{Scheherazade}, the sultan's wife who, according to legend, told captivating stories each night to postpone her execution. Through her wit and storytelling, she not only saved her own life but also the lives of many other women. The latter restaurant draws its name from the iconic \alert{Colosseum} in Rome, symbolizing the grandeur of Italian heritage.

		Located near the Kanonenplatz, this war memorial was erected in 1930 to honor the soldiers of the \alert{\enquote{5th Badenisches Feldartillerie-Regiment Nr. 76}}, based in Freiburg and active during World War I. The regiment had a close relationship with the city, and the monument remains a place of remembrance.

		The \alert{\enquote{Ludwigshöhe}}, named after Grand Duke Ludwig I of Baden, this high point on the southern slope of the Schlossberg was laid out in the 19th century as a scenic overlook and picnic area. It offers sweeping views toward the Rhine Valley and the Kaiserstuhl hills. It was part of a romantic landscaping effort to make the hill more accessible for leisure walks.

		The \alert{\enquote{Silberbrunnen} (silver fountain)} lies in a quiet, wooded section of the Schlossberg and dates back to medieval times. It supplied water to both the castle and city below. According to local legend, the name comes from the silvery shimmer of the water or possibly from silver coins found near the spring. Its cool water still flows today.

		There's also the \alert{\enquote{Kleiner Kanonenplatz} (little cannon plaza)}, it's a smaller, lesser-known platform located above the main Kanonenplatz. It offers a more intimate view over the city and was also part of the historic French fortification system built by Vauban in the late 17th century.

		The \alert{Tusculum} is a modest villa-like structure built in the 19th century as a leisure and event house for Freiburg’s educated elite. Named after the ancient Roman retreat town of Tusculum, it was a symbol of cultured urban recreation. Today, it's occasionally used for cultural events and private gatherings.

		The \alert{\enquote{Festung Freiburger Schlossberg}} is a historical trail. This self-guided historical walking route, marked with signs and maps, takes visitors through the remaining fortification structures from the Vauban era and earlier medieval layers. It traces bastions, walls, trenches, and casemates, offering rich context through on-site information boards.

		Located near a former forest trail junction, the \alert{\enquote{Husarenbrunnen}} (Hussars’ fountain) is a small spring named after the light cavalry units (Hussars) who are said to have watered their horses here in the 19th century, possibly during Prussian military movements or training exercises in the region.

		The \alert{\enquote{Martinsfelsen}} (Martin’s rock), is a rugged sandstone outcrop located just below the summit plateau of the Roßkopf. It is named after St. Martin, one of the most venerated saints in the region. It may have been a historic waypoint for pilgrims or shepherds, although no formal shrine existed here.


		Our trip begins at the \alert{\enquote{Schwabentor} (swabian gate)}, one of the two remaining medieval city gates of Freiburg im Breisgau. This striking gate, whose name translates to "Swabian Gate," is not just an architectural relic, it's a doorway into centuries of history, legend, and the cultural crossroads of southern Germany.

		The \enquote{Schwabentor} was built around 1250 as part of Freiburg’s second city wall expansion. At the time, Freiburg was growing rapidly, and the city’s leadership recognized the need for better fortifications. The gate stood as both a protective bulwark and a checkpoint for traders and travelers entering the city from the south and southeast, especially from the direction of the Swabian regions which gives the gate its name.
		Perhaps the most captivating feature of the \enquote{Schwabentor} is the large fresco on its inner wall, painted by Fritz Geiges in 1903. It depicts a Swabian merchant who, according to legend, once tried to buy all of Freiburg with a cart full of gold, but when it turned out his \enquote{gold} was just sand-covered rocks, he was laughed out of town.

		This legend, while likely apocryphal, ties into a long-standing rivalry and playful mockery between the people of Baden (where Freiburg is located) and Swabians to the east. Hence, the name \alert{Swabian Gate} could be a mix of historical reference and local humor.


		The \alert{\enquote{Schwabentorsteg} (swabian gate footbridge)} is a covered wooden pedestrian bridge located at the eastern edge of Freiburg’s Old Town. Built in 1970, the bridge spans the Schlossbergring, a four-lane bypass road encircling the historic city center. Measuring approximately 25 meters in length, the Schwabentorsteg blends harmoniously with the historic atmosphere of the Old Town thanks to its traditional wooden construction.

		% Its purpose is to connect Salzstraße, one of Freiburg’s oldest and most charming streets, directly with the Schlossberg, the city's iconic castle hill.
		Nestled between the slopes of the Roßkopf and the Schönberg, the \alert{Wildtal} is a peaceful side valley of the Glottertal, just northeast of Freiburg. Though easily accessible, it retains the charm of a secluded rural landscape with deep roots in the region’s natural and cultural history.

		The name \alert{\enquote{Wildtal}} literally means \enquote{Wild Valley}, and is believed to derive from the abundance of wild animals, especially deer and boar, that once roamed the area. In medieval times, it served as a hunting ground for local nobility and monastic orders. %The name likely also reflects the dense, uncultivated forests that once covered the slopes before extensive clearing began in the Middle Ages.

		%Perched at approximately 478 meters above sea level on a ridge between the Wildtal and Gundelfingen, this castle is considered the ancestral seat of the House of Zähringen, one of the most influential noble families in southwest Germany.
		On the way into the Wildtal, we pass the \alert{Zähringer Castle Ruin} (\enquote{Zähringer Burg}), a site of great historical significance. The original Zähringer Castle was likely constructed around the early 11th century, though the first documented reference appears in 1128. It served as a fortified residence for the Zähringer dukes, who controlled extensive territories across Baden, Switzerland, and parts of Alsace.
