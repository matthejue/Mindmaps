            \item \alert{Hardware Security} goes beyond classical cryptography, does not only consider the algorithm itself, but it considers the implementation of the algorithms (e.g. AES is believed to be secure, but attacks against the implementation like the side-channel attack: power analysis are pretty successful). % It protects the implementations of cryptographic algorithms against physical attacks, side-channel attacks etc.
              % - Avoids tampering with devices

Can also be described as computing the multiplicative inverse in $GF(2^8)$. Because of the nonlinaer elements, the S-Boxes one can't use that there's a connection between plaint text and cipher text because of linearity

Each $4$-byte column is considered as a vector and multiplied by a fixed $4\times 4$ matrix.

Boxes are \alert{identical} for all terms, so one does multiplication with the same matrix and this matrix is fixed for AES. This matrix needs to have the property of being \alert{invertable}

The subkeys are generated in the \alert{key schedule}, they are derived from the original key $k$. Is the only part that depends on the key and everything is else is to hide what one did and make the decryption without knowing the key much more difficult, such that it's never much simpler than a brute-force attack for which the number of keys is too large.

                              \item \script{113}{Key Schedule (pr.,f.)}, subkeys are derived recursively from the original 128/192/256-bit input key, $\#subkeys = \#rounds + 1$, each round has $1$ subkey, plus $1$ subkey at the beginning of AES. \alert{Key whitening:} Subkey is used both at the input and output of AES. There are different key schedules for the different key sizes. Called subkeys, because for key-length 192 and 256 they are subkeys, for 128 too even though it doesn't make sense to call them subkeys. The only really random part os the original key. The round key number $0$ is the original key. If one would also do it the same for the first, one would have a cyclic dependency. For round key $2$ its almost the same with the difference, that in the different rounds the $g$ functions are slightly different. \script{114}{Function $g$} rotates its four input bytes and performs a bytewise S-Box substitution (\textit{the same} as before) $\rightarrow$ nonlinearity. The \alert{round coefficient} RC is only added to the leftmost byte and \textit{varies from round to round}. Until $RC[8]$ it is leftshift, then one can't shift anymore and chooses elements of the Galois field again. \underline{Hint:} Multiplication in Galois field has something to do with multiplicatin of polynomials. Only on byte where on adds this $RC[i]$. $x_i$ represents an element in the Galois field $GF(2^8)$
% , in each round transformation of the original key, for keywidth 128 one has $10$ rounds and for them one needs $11$ round keys derived from the secret key $k$,

                    \begin{itemize}
                      \item only works if the attacker doesn't know the algorithm, this is not optimal, because one has to hide the algorithm or consider this $n$ also as part of the key, but then $n$ has to be very large to avoid a brute-force attack. Pairs are not hidden, but the unigram attack still works (\script{86}{summary here})
